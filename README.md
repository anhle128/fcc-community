Welcome to the Free Code Camp Community Project! Everyone is welcome (and encouraged) to make contributions. Don't worry if you are new to Github, or even to coding, [we can help you](https://gitter.im/fcc-community/fcc-community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) get started contributing!

Our goal is to bring the FCC community together by providing an easier way to share and join meetups, events, and GitHub projects from other members. 

Another cool feature we want to bring to life is the ability for members to schedule a rigorous coding-camp-style where individuals or groups of people will strive to finish the FCC Curriculum faster, all while keeping track of their progress.

All help is welcomed!
